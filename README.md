# Deep-Learning-Applications-in-Retinal-Disease-Detection
Worldwide,  the  most  common  causes  of  blindness  are  diabetic  retinopathy,  cataract  and glaucoma.  
Timely  detection  is  the  key  to  prevent  blindness  via  retinal  image  screening.  However, the  traditional  diagnostics  methods  are  labor  intensive  and  demand  an  expert  to  manage  making it  near  impossible  scale.  
As  the  name  suggests, this  project  focuses  on  deep  learning  solutions  for detecting  retinal  diseases.  More  specifically,  CNN  models  will  be  built  and  contrasted  with Transfer  Learning  using  pre-trained  models  followed  by  a  hybrid  CNN-LSTM  technique.  
These models  are  to  classify  retinal  images  into  four  classes:  normal,  diabetic-retinopathy,  cataract  and glaucoma using these two types of features.
